UI

Our UI system is structured around Panels. A Panel is a c# class that can have parent and child panels.

The panels use a stylesheet and flex system for layout and rendering.

They can be created directly in code or via Razor files with HT ML/CSS syntax.

Making a C# Panel

Here's a basic example of a Panel that simply displays Time.Now :

public class MyPanel : Panel
 public Label MyLabel { get; set; }

 public MyPanel()
 MyLabel = new Label();
 MyLabel.Parent = this;

 public override void Tick()
 MyLabel.Text = $"{Time.Now}";

Using a Panel

Once you've create a Panel, it can be used in two different ways. The first is done identically to how we

added a Label in the example above:

var myPanel = new MyPanel();
myPanel.Parent = this;

The other is by using the following syntax within a [Razor Panels] file:

<MyPanel />

Creating a C# Root Panel

To draw your UI to either the Screen or to a World Panel, you'll need to create a PanelComponent. A

PanelComponent acts as the root ofall UI, and is added to any GameObject with either a ScreenPanel or

WorldPanel component. Here's an example of how you can create a basic one including the above panel:

public sealed class MyRootPanel : PanelComponent

MyPanel myPanel;

protected override void OnTreeFirstBuilt()

base.OnTreeFirstBuilt();

myPanel = new MyPanel();
myPanel.Parent = Panel;

Scaling

By default, ScreenPanels will rescaleall UI based on a 1080p target height automatically. If you wish to

disable this, or change the scaling to target the Desktop Resolution, you can change the following:
