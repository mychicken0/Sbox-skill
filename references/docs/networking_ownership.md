Ownership

Networked GameObjects can be owned by a connection.

Objects that are owned by a connection are simulated by that connection. T heir position and their

variables areall controlled by the controlling client.

If an object is unowned by a connection then it is simulated by the host.

Owner T ransf er

By default, a networked object's owner can only be changed by the host. However, the current owner of

the object can change that behavior by setting its OwnerTransfer value.

// Make it so anyone can change the owner of this networked object.
go.Network.SetOwnerTransfer( OwnerTransfer.Takeover );

T yp e

B e ha vio ur

OwnerTransfer.Takeover

Anyone can change the owner

OwnerTransfer.Fixed (default)

Only the host can change the owner

OwnerTransfer.Request

A request must be made to the host to change the owner

Getting the Owner

You can find the owner of a GameObject by checking Network.OwnerId .

public override void Update()

Log.Info( $"Owner is {Network.OwnerId}" );

In reality, day to day, you won't really be interested in the particular owner. You only care about whether

you're meant to be simulating it or not. You do that by checking IsProxy - which is true if the

GameObject is being simulated by another client (or the server).

public override void Update()

 if ( IsProxy ) return;

 // if we pressed E, try to pick something up
 if ( Input.Pressed( "use" ) )
 TryPickup();

T aking Ownership

You can take ownership of an object, which makes you the simulator.

void TryPickup()

// are we looking at anything?
var tr = Physics.Trace.WithoutTags( "player" )

.Sphere( 16, EyePos, EyePos + LookDir.Forward * 100 )
.Run();

if ( !tr.Hit ) return;

if ( tr.Body.GameObject is not GameObject go )

return;

if ( !go.Tags.Has( "pickup" ) )

return;

 // You're my wife now

go.Network.TakeOwnership();

 // Store that we're carrying it

Carrying = go;

So for example, if a player picks up an object, the player could take ownership of that object. That way the

position is controlled by that player.

If a player gets in a car, you could make the player the owner of that car - then its position will be

controlled by that player.

And of course, the player is generally controlled by its own connection.

Dropping Ownership

You can also stop owning an object. At that point the object becomes owned by the server.

void ThrowObject()

if ( !Carrying.IsValid() )

return;

// Stop owning this

Carrying.Network.DropOwnership();
Carrying = null;

Default Owners

If you make an object in the scene editor networked, by default it will not have an owner. It will be

simulated by the host.

When a client creates a network object via GameObject.NetworkSpawn() , they will be the owner of that

object.

Disconnection

By defaultall networked objects that a client owns will be destroyed for everyone when they disconnect.

You can change this by setting the Orphaned Mode for that networked object. Only the current owner

can change the Orphaned Mode.

Simply call GameObject.Network.SetOrphanedMode with one of the following options:

T yp e

B e ha vio ur

NetworkOrphaned.Destroy

(default)

The object will be destroyed when the owner disconnects

NetworkOrphaned.Host

The host will be assigned ownership when the current owner disconnects

NetworkOrphaned.Random

A random client will be assigned ownership when the current owner

disconnects

NetworkOrphaned.ClearOwner

The object will remain but ownership will be cleared (the host will

simulate the object)
