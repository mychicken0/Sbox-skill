Connection Permissions

The host can change some permissions for a specific Connection . The ideal place to set these

permissions would be in the OnActive network event.

Spawning Objects

You can set Connection.CanSpawnObjects to allow or disallow a specific connection to create their own

networked objects. By default this is true .

Refreshing Objects

By default only the host can send network refresh updates for networked objects. This can be changed to

allow the owner of a networked object to also send these updates with Connection.CanRefreshObjects .
