Recording API

You can record gameplay into a MovieClip, which can be played back or imported into Movie Maker for

editing. This could be useful for killcams in shooters, leaderboard replays in racing games, or for capturing

gameplay to edit into a trailer.

This feature is provided by the MovieRecorder class. You can use its default behaviour to captureall

display-related components in the scene, or configure it to capture only certain objects, components and

properties.

Recording Basics

By default, a MovieRecorder will captureall Renderers, Cameras, SoundPoints and particle-related

components. Just create a recorder, and call Start.

// Create a recorder using the default capturing options
var recorder = new MovieRecorder( Scene );

// Start capturing
recorder.Start();

This starts capturing the scene every fixed update. When you want to stop recording, call Stop.

// Stop capturing
recorder.Stop();

You can then compile the recording into a MovieClip for playback in a MoviePlayer, or to save into a

MovieResource.

// Convert the recording to a MovieClip
var clip = recorder.ToClip();

// Play the clip!
GetComponent<MoviePlayer>().Play( clip );

// Save it to a .movie
FileSystem.Data.WriteJson( $"movies/example.movie", clip.ToResource() );

Manual Capture

Instead of Start and Stop, call Advance to move the recording along by an amount of time, and Capture to

record a frame.

while ( IsRecording )
 SimulateScene();

 // Move the recording time along by 10ms
 recorder.Advance( 0.01 );

 // Capture a frame
 recorder.Capture();

Configuring Recorders

If you want to be more selective about what gets recorded, create a MovieRecorderOptions instance and

pass it in to the MovieRecorder constructor. These options let you specify the sample rate, filter which

GameObjects are allowed to be captured, and add actions to run during each capture.

A new options instance won't capture anything, letting you fully configure it.

var options = new MovieRecorderOptions( SampleRate: 60 )
 .WithCaptureAll<Player>()
 .WithComponentCapturer<PlayerCapturer>()
 .WithCaptureAction( x => x
 .GetTrackRecorder( scoreManager )
 .Property( "Score" )
 .Capture() );

var recorder = new MovieRecorder( Scene, options );

Def ault Options

If you want to base your configuration off the default options (which capturesall renderers, cameras,

particles etc), you can access it through MovieRecorderOptions.Default.

var options = MovieRecorderOptions.Default with { SampleRate = 60 }
 .WithFilter( x => !x.Tags.Has( "effect" ) );

You can customize the default options by creating one or more static methods with a

[DefaultMovieRecorderOptions] attribute, like this:

[DefaultMovieRecorderOptions]
public static MovieRecorderOptions BuildDefaultOptions( MovieRecorderOptions options )

return options

.WithFilter( x => !x.Tags.Has( "viewmodel" ) )

.WithFilter( x => x.PrefabInstanceSource?.StartsWith( "prefabs/surface/" ) is

The default options will be used when pressing the Record button in the Movie Maker editor, and the

movie  console command in-game.

Sample Rate

By default, property tracks in the generated recording are resampled at 30 FPS to keep file sizes small. You

can choose a different rate when creating a MovieRecorderOptions, or use the with syntax on an existing

instance.

var options = new MovieRecorderOptions( SampleRate: 60 );

var options = MovieRecorderOptions.Default with { SampleRate = 60 };

Filters

Adding filters lets you control which GameObjects are allowed to be captured. Components won't be

recorded if their containing GameObject, or any of its ancestors, are filtered out. The first time a capture is

attempted on an object, it is checked againstall provided filters. If any return false, that object and any of

its descendants will be ignored during recording.

var options = MovieRecorderOptions.Default
 .WithFilter( x => !x.Tags.Has( "effect" ) )
 .WithFilter( x => !x.Name.StartsWith( "decal_" ) );

Capture Actions

Every time Capture is called on a MovieRecorder, it goes throughall the capture actions in its

MovieRecorderOptions. These actions will then access track recorders for GameObjects, Components, and

properties, then call Capture on them.

// Capture "ExampleProperty" from inside exampleComponent
var options = new MovieRecorderOptions()
 .WithCaptureAction( x => x
 .GetTrackRecorder( exampleComponent )
 .Property( "ExampleProperty" )
 .Capture() );

Component Capturers

Most of the time you'll want to capture specific properties fromall instances of a given component type.

To simplify this, you can implement ComponentCapturer<T>. Whenever Capture is called on a

component's track recorder, all component capturer instances that match that component's type will be

invoked.

protected override void OnCapture( IMovieTrackRecorder recorder, ModelRenderer com

recorder.Property( nameof( ModelRenderer.Model ) ).Capture();
recorder.Property( nameof( ModelRenderer.Tint ) ).Capture();
recorder.Property( nameof( ModelRenderer.MaterialOverride ) ).Capture();
recorder.Property( nameof( ModelRenderer.RenderType ) ).Capture();

if ( component.HasBodyGroups )

recorder.Property( nameof( ModelRenderer.BodyGroups ) ).Capture();

All capturers with public parameterless constructors will be included in MovieRecorderOptions.Default, or

you can manually add capturers to an options instance. These capturers are invoked when Capture is

called on a matching component's track recorder.

var options = new MovieRecorderOptions()
 .WithComponentCapturer( new ModelRendererCapturer() )
 .WithCaptureAction( recorder =>
 foreach ( var renderer in recorder.Scene.GetAllComponents<ModelRenderer>() )
 // This will look for matching ComponentCapturers
 recorder.GetTrackRecorder( renderer )?.Capture();

For convenience, WithCaptureAll does the same job as the above example capture action.

var options = new MovieRecorderOptions()
 .WithComponentCapturer( new ModelRendererCapturer() )
 .WithCaptureAll<ModelRenderer>();
