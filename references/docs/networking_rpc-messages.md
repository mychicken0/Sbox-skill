RPC Messages

Components can contain RPCs. An RPC is a function that when called, is called remotely too.

Supported RPC arguments are the exact same as Sync properties.

Example

Imagine your game has a button, and you want it to make a bing noise when it's pressed. You could have a

function like this.

void OnPressed()

Sound.Play( "bing", WorldPosition );

The problem here is, that sound is only played on the host, or on the client where OnPressed is called. You

want everyone to hear that sound. So you instead do something like this.

void OnPressed()

PlayOpenEffects();

[Rpc.Broadcast]
public void PlayOpenEffects()

Sound.Play( "bing", WorldPosition );

The attribute [Rpc.Broadcast] makes it so when you call that function, it broadcasts a network message

to everyone to call that function too. Without any flags, anyone could technically call that function, but

you could add flags to restrict it to only the host, or only the owner of the object. See the Flags section

below for more details.

Static RPC

Static methods can be RPCs, too. A static RPC does not need to exist on a Component but can exist as a

method on any static class.

public static void PlaySoundAllClients( string soundName, Vector3 position )

Sound.Play( soundName, position );

Rpc.Owner

Unlike [Rpc.Broadcast] which calls the function for everybody, you can use [Rpc.Owner] instead which

means that the function will only be called for the Owner of the networked object or the host if the object

has no owner.

Rpc.Host

Similarly to Rpc.Owner, adding this will mean the function is only called on the Host.

Flags

When defining an RPC, you can define a number of flags.

[Rpc.Broadcast( NetFlags.Unreliable | NetFlag.OwnerOnly )]
public static void PlaySoundAllClients( string soundName, Vector3 position )

NetFlags.Unreliable

NetFlags.Reliable

Message will be sent unreliably. It may not arrive and it may be received out of

order. But chances are that it will arrive on time and everything will be fine. This is

good for sending position updates, or spawning effects. This is the fastest way to

send a message. It is also the cheapest.

This is the default, so you don't need to specify this. Message will be sent reliably.

Multiple attempts will be made until the recipient has received it. Use this for things

like chat messages, or important events. This is the slowest way to send a

message. It is also the most expensive.

NetFlags.SendImmediate

Message will not be grouped up with other messages, and will be sent

immediately. This is most useful for things like streaming voice data, where

packets need to stream in real-time, rather than arriving with a bunch of other

packets.

NetFlags.DiscardOnDelay

Message will be dropped if it can't be sent quickly. Only applicable to unreliable

messages.

NetFlags.HostOnly

This RPC can only be called from the Host.

NetFlags.OwnerOnly

This RPC can only be called from the owner of the object it's being called on. 

You can pass arguments to the RPC like any other method, and they'll get passed magically.

void OnPressed()

PlayOpenEffects( "bing", WorldPosition );

[Rpc.Broadcast]
public void PlayOpenEffects( string soundName, Vector3 position )

Sound.Play( soundName, position );

Filtering

You can filter the recipients of a Broadcast RPC. This allows you to exclude specific connections from

receiving the RPC, or only include specific connections.

// Don't send the RPC to player's called Harry (sorry Harry!)
using ( Rpc.FilterExclude( c => c.DisplayName == "Harry" ) )

PlayOpenEffects( "bing", WorldPosition );

// Only send the RPC to player's called Garry.
using ( Rpc.FilterInclude( c => c.DisplayName == "Garry" ) )

PlayOpenEffects( "bing", WorldPosition );

Caller Information

You can check which connection called the method using the Rpc.Caller class.

void OnPressed()

PlayOpenEffects( "bing", WorldPosition );

[Rpc.Broadcast]
public void PlayOpenEffects( string soundName, Vector3 position )

if ( !Rpc.Caller.IsHost ) return;

Log.Info( $"{Rpc.Caller.DisplayName} with the steamid {Rpc.Caller.SteamId} played
Sound.Play( soundName, position );
