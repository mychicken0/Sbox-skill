Tracing

Scenes can be traced against using Scene.Trace - which uses a builder pattern to make construction a

bit easier. At a minimum, traces have a shape, start, and end. You can also filter which specific tags will be

hit or ignored, or opt-in to using your project's collision rule matrix by calling WithCollisionRules(tag) .

Here are some examples.

Simplest Trace

SceneTraceResult tr = Scene.Trace.Ray( startPos, endPos ).Run();

if ( tr.Hit )

Log.Info( $"Hit: {tr.GameObject} at {tr.EndPosition}" );

Use Collision Rules

This will fire a ray using the collision rules of a bullet tag, as configured in your project's Collision settings.

var tr = Scene.Trace

.Ray( startPos, endPos )
.WithCollisionRules( "bullet" ) // Hits everything that a bullet would hit
.Run();

Sphere Trace

var tr = Scene.Trace

.Sphere( 32.0f, startPos, endPos ) // 32 is the radius
.WithoutTags( "player" ) // ignore GameObjects with this tag
.Run();

Box Trace

var tr = Scene.Trace

.Ray( start, end )

.Size( new BBox( -5, 5 ) ) // size of the aabb
.UseHitboxes( true ) // hit hitboxes too!
.Run();

Debugging traces

You can visualize traces in the editor by calling DebugOverlay.Trace(tr) - this will draw the trace and the

hit point if there was a hit.

var tr = Scene.Trace
 .Ray( start, end )
 .Run();

DebugOverlay.Trace( tr, 5f ); // lasts for 5 seconds
