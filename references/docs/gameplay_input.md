Input

Input is accessed using the… Input class!

public sealed class MyPlayerComponent : Component

protected override void OnUpdate()

if ( Input.Down( "jump" ) )

WorldPosition += Vector3.Forward * Time.Delta;

Here you can see that when jump is pressed down, the GameObject will move forward. We multiply forward

by the time delta to make it frame rate independent.

T here are a few different ways to query buttons..

Input.Down( "jump" ) // key is held down (button name is case insensitive)
Input.Pressed( "jump" ) // key was just pressed this frame
Input.Released( "jump" ) // key was just released this frame

Input.AnalogMove // joystick "move" input Vector3 (or wsad)
Input.AnalogLook // Joystick "look" input Vector3 (mouse look)

Custom Keys

You can customize the keys for your game in the Project Settings.

By default, s&box will show the pause menu when a player presses the ESC key in-game.

You can override this functionality:

// In Update() on one of your components
if ( Input.EscapePressed )

Input.EscapePressed = false;
// handle escape pressed in your game

If you override the escape button it'll be up to you to let the user access settings etc in your own menu

system.
